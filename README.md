# What is this?
A simple Flask server using the AutoTrader library to connect to Oanda for trading forex, crypto, and precious metals.  
This repo takes care of the bootstrappy bits so it's ready-to-deploy on a home computer or in the cloud.

# What can it do?
It has a couple of built-in endpoints for checking your balance or placing an order.
Additional features and commands can be added by exploring AutoTrader's documentation.

# How do I use it?
Simply put your keys into the config/keys.yaml file and run it from its folder on the command line ('flask run') or deploy it to a service like Heroku.
